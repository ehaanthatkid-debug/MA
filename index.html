        <h2>Why I chose cricket:</h2>
        <p>
            Cricket is my favorite sport, I've been playing and following cricket since I was about 9 years old. 
            My introduction to cricket was through my dad and my uncle, and overall just my heritage as in India cricket is 
            by far the most popular sport, and is followed as passionately as religion.

            <strong>Basic overview:</strong> Cricket can seem easy at first but in reality is very complicated. 
            It involves 2 teams of 11 players each, and at a time one team will "bat" while the other will "bowl/field". 
            There are 3 main forms of cricket: T20, ODI, and Test Matches. Each over has 6 balls in it, bowled by one 
            bowler to the batsman. In T20 there are 20 overs per team, in ODI the over limit is 50, and in Test matches 
            there is no over limit, with 2 innings per team going on for up to 5 days.

    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Two teams of 11, one bats and one bowls per inning</li>
        <li>At a time there are 2 batsmen on the field: a striker facing the ball and a non-striker ready to run</li>

    </ol>
